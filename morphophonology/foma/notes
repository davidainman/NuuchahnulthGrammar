 * in Basket Ogres1:
 analysed 83 sentences
          157 wordtypes
          394 wordtokens
          2 tokens were rejected (0.51%)
          17 tokens were ambiguous
 * much spurious ambiguity resulting from final -s (allative applicative) vs
   =s (3.pos clitic); beck's grammar says the -s only occurs in stems that have
   -il (either inchoative suff or synchronically unanalyzeable), implementing
   this restriction to cut down on ambiguity
   ** implemented, now down to 7 ambig tokens with same coverage

according to beck, the affixal template looks like this:

-1
dxw(s)- ‘CTD’

0
√R(V)

1
-il ‘INCH’

2
-b ‘MD’
-agwil ‘AUTO’
-alikw ‘ACT’
-iluɬ ‘PRPV’
-əɬ ‘INCRP’
-áb ‘MTHD’

3
-txw ‘ECS’
-dxw ‘DC’

4
-yi- ‘DAT’
-bi- ‘MAP’
-di-/-i- ‘SS’

5
-t ‘ICS’
-c/-s ‘ALTV’
-b ‘CSMD’

Note that we still need to squeeze in lexical suffixes and reduplication!

For now, order things like this:

0, Redup (not above) , -1 (prefix) , 1 ,2 ,3 etc


Note: we also need to divide out constant lexes that don't undergo derivation/inflection

Note: the above is for derivation, the aspectual prefixes would be in -2

Note: we have to add proclitics as they come attached.  Also note that these
can attach to constant lexes as well.  For now, at least:
ƛ̕u=
HAB
tu=
PAST
